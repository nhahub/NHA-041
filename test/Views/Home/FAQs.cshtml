                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>1. What do I need to adopt a pet?</h3>
                    <p>All adopters must be at least 18 years old and provide a valid ID. You’ll also need to fill out an adoption form and meet the pet in person before approval.</p>

                    <p>Yes, there’s a small adoption fee that helps cover vaccinations, microchipping, and spaying/neutering. The amount may vary depending on the animal.</p>
